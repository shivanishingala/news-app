Getting the best quality brew in the most efficient manner has been the goal of many coffee and tea brewers for many years.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Over the last two decades the coffee and tea industry has evolved from a commodity based industry to one of specialty products, retail outlets and consumer driven increase of quality and cost. Starbucks Corporation sparked the evolution within the industry in the United States resulting in retail concept and beverage concept innovation, the birth of the US style “Cafe Culture” and consumer demand for better quality coffee products. However, this entire evolution of the coffee industry was built on the methods and technologies developed over 80 years ago.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The French press was invented in the 1850's. The espresso machine was created in 1822. Emerson's vacuum brewer was invented in 1922. Melitta Bentz's coffee filters were invented in 1908. There have been numerous modifications, improvements and automations to these processes and apparatuses over the years. However, despite the explosion of beverage and retail innovation over the last two decades not one significant new brewing/infusing process has emerged.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In 2006 The Coffee Equipment Company launched “the Clover”, which is an automated French press, capable of making a hot beverage in less than 60 seconds. The apparatus proved that there is a need for single serving, quick turn over and created a niche in the industry where ultra premium coffees could now be brewed and served by the cup in an acceptable retail turnover rate. The Coffee Equipment Company was soon recognized for their “Clover” by Starbucks and was purchased in 2008. The purchase created a void in the market for a single serving brewer capable of creating ultra premium drinks in under 60 seconds.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The “cold brewing” of coffee and tea has also been practiced for countless years in countries around the world. This process involves the soaking and or brewing/infusing of coffee or tea with room temperature water in a vessel for 12 to 24 hours. This process is considered by many as the optimal method to extracting the right solid from the dried media. However, the process takes too much time for the typical consumer.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The niche created by the “Clover” and the “cold brewing” method became the inspiration for the development of the inventive process and apparatus described herein. The goal was to create a process that could be versatile enough to be used to brew both coffee and tea, as well as to brew using both with hot and cold water. The invention is a completely new and unique process which does not adhere to any of the restrictions or methods of anything that has ever existed. The process, which brews in a vacuum environment, has tremendous range in all the parameters and can be utilized to brew as quickly or slowly, as hot or as cold as desired in less time then conventional methods allow.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The term “vacuum” has been used in the past in connection with the brewing of coffee. For example, in 1922 Emerson was issued U.S. Pat. No. 1,674,857 for a “vacuum” brewing process. This conventional process involves an upper and lower vessel. The lower vessel holds water and is placed above a heat source. The upper vessel holds the dried media or coffee. The upper vessel, resembling a funnel with a long neck, sits atop the lower vessel. The long stem from the upper vessel goes down into the lower vessel below the water level. The two are connected via an airtight seal at the top of the lower vessel and the beginning of the neck for the upper.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\" class=\"description-paragraph\">When the water is heated it rises through the tube into the upper vessel and saturates the dried media in the funnel of the upper vessel. Once the heat is removed a “vacuum” occurs in the lower vessel as the water vapor contracts as it cools. The resulting vacuum creates a suction which pulls the liquid from the upper vessel back down to the lower vessel. Therefore, the “vacuum” acts as a mechanism to create extract or to suck the liquid through the coffee and filter in order to separate the two. There is no point where the coffee or dried media brew inside a vacuum during the process defined by Emerson. Similar systems are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,295,920 to Barden et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 2,467,817 to Dietz.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Automated “vacuum” brewers such as Starbucks's “Clover” operate under the same principal of brewing under normal atmospheric conditions while using suction/vacuum pressure below a filter as a mechanism to separate liquid from solids. There is no suggestion of brewing the water and dried media completely inside a vacuum chamber while negative pressure is occurring.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In 1935 Davis was granted U.S. Pat. No. 2,079,603 that describes a coffee maker wherein a “vacuum” is partially created to aid as a mechanism to create movement within the brewing apparatus. During the brewing process the heating of the water creates steam pressure which actually suspends the upper vessel like a hot air balloon above a steaming pot of water. When the heat is removed the steam pressure cools thus creating a vacuum, allowing the upper vessel, with dried media (coffee) to descend into the hot water. When the vacuum has pulled all available water inside the vessel, outside air is pulled in through the open spouts through the coffee creating a bubbling action.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The liquid in the Davis system is not boiling or bubbling due to a lack of surface pressure, but is bubbling due to the air which is getting pulled in through available vents into the process chamber. Since the entire apparatus is not sealed there is no possibility for the brewing to occur in a stabilized vacuum. Nor is there any mention of the brewing process occurring in a vacuum.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Although coffee, tea and other beverages have not previously been brewed in a vacuum, it has been suggested to use a vacuum to cook other food products. For example, in 1940 Smaltz was granted U.S. Pat. No. 2,203,638 for a “Vacuum Cooking and Cooling” process for the processing of pie fillings, fruit preserves or the similar food products. According to the patent, a vacuum is pulled until all evaporation is complete. This is achieved by continuously running the vacuum pump and expelling the vacated vapor and air while the vacuum component of the process is being applied. There are no one way valves or manual valves that would allow for the vacuum to be regulated at anything other than the maximum capacity of the pump which is −29 Hg in.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\" class=\"description-paragraph\">As the Smaltz patent states, 29 inches of mercury vacuum will cause the pie filling to rapidly cool thereby halting the cooking process while allowing the product to cool rapidly without separating. He mentions that the vacuum/cooling process is a part of the process to reach a final finished product, whereas the removal of water vapors and temperature is defined as part of the “cooking” and “cooling” process. Cooking is defined as preparing under the application of heat. Therefore, Smaltz is only cooling with a vacuum, not cooking and there is no suggestion therein that his process can be used to brew coffee or tea or other beverage.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\" class=\"description-paragraph\">U.S. Pat. No. 2,885,294 issued to Larson in 1959 for an invention entitled “Oven and Method of Preparing Food”. The patent describes the beginning of the cooking process where a super atmospheric cycle or a “downward displacement” method are utilized to remove ambient air, which is replaced by steam pressure to cook the foodstuff quickly, without contaminants and without “impregnating” or saturating the interior of the foodstuff with water molecules. The ambient air is removed to prevent the loss of vitamins or nutritional elements as well as to avoid the “impregnation” and or saturation of the foodstuff with water molecules during the cooking process.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Larson mentions using a vacuum pump in the beginning of the cooking process for the sole reason of removing ambient air. This void is then filled with the expanding gasses of steam which is heated further by the heated walls of the oven, thus resulting in a positive pressure atmosphere. The cooking, therefore, does not actually take place in a vacuum. Furthermore, there is no suggestion in Larson that his process can be used to brew coffee or tea.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\" class=\"description-paragraph\">A need clearly exists for a beverage brewing machine and process that can provide a quick and efficient method for brewing or infusing a high quality consumable substance, such as beverages or other types of food products, including fats, oils, and vinegars.

The chemical resistance of the glass is required to ensure that the vessel can be washed after each use without retaining any oils or flavors from the previous brew or infusion cycle, so as not to contaminate the beverage or consumable substance.

Depending on the type of beverage or consumable substance being brewed or infused, the consumable substance may be heated in the range of about 150° F.-250° F., and preferably between 175° F.-212° F. In other embodiments, the consumable substance may be heated within lower temperature ranges, such as between 75° F.-175° F. In other embodiments, the consumable substance may be heated to higher temperature ranges, for example 250° F.-350° F., for example when the consumable substance comprises an oil or fatty acid. It should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to any particular brewing or infusing temperature, so long as the process achieves the extraction of the desired liquids or solids to achieve the desired flavor of beverage or infused consumable substance. It should be appreciated that the present invention is suitable for brewing or infusing under a controlled vacuum pressure below room temperature, at about room temperature, or above room temperature.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In another embodiment, a “cold brewing/infusing” process achieves the proper extraction of the infusion material via a prolonged brew/infuse time at approximately room temperature while under a controlled vacuum pressure and/or multiple vacuum cycles. As previously noted, cold brewing or infusing processes in the prior art typically require long brew or infusion times in the range of 12-24 h. The cold brewing or infusion process of the present invention can significantly reduce the time for brewing or infusing at or below room temperature through the use of reduced pressure and/or vacuum cycles. For example, the cold brewing/infusing process of the present invention can achieve the proper extraction of the infusion material in a range for brew time of 1 min. to 12 hours, and more preferably within a range of 0.5 to 5 hours. A person skilled in the art would recognize that the reduced cold brewing or infusing process time afforded by the methods of the present invention makes a cold brewing/infusing process more appealing to consumers, while also improving the feasibility and/or efficiency of implementing a cold brewing/infusing process on larger scale, i.e., for commercial production using a cold brewing/infusing process.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Additionally, the cold brewing/infusing process of the present invention may also provide the benefit of sanitary, i.e., aseptic or sterile, brewing or infusing because the process is carried out in a sealed vessel under vacuum. The cold brewing/infusing process of the present invention can reduce or eliminate the introduction of microbes into the beverage or consumable substance during the brewing process because the brewing/infusing chamber, as described herein, is sealed from the surrounding environment during brewing or infusing. The cold brewing/infusing process of the present invention can also reduce or eliminate microbial growth during the brewing/infusing process because the process involves the removal of air via vacuum during brewing/infusing. A person skilled in the art would recognize that most spoilage microorganisms are aerobic, and thus the removal of air during the brewing/infusing process would inhibit microbial growth.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The hot or heated consumable substance process requires that the temperature range be maintained within the necessary range throughout the brewing/infusion process in order to properly extract the desired infusion material. Temperature loss of the hot consumable substance can occur when a vacuum is created within the <figure-callout id=\"3\" label=\"chamber\" filenames=\"US11421192-20220823-D00000.png,US11421192-20220823-D00001.png\" state=\"{{state}}\">chamber</figure-callout> <b>3</b>, when the water or consumable substance begins to boil below temperature and the water or consumable substance vapors are removed. At standard atmospheric pressure, water boils at 212° F. However, a “boiling” effect occurs when the vacuum decreases air pressure above the liquid water, thus allowing the water to become unstable and “boil” although under 212° F. As would be understood by a person skilled in the art, the temperature range of the brewing or infusion process can be optimized depending on the composition of the consumable substance.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The cooler the temperature of the water or consumable substance, the deeper the vacuum needs to be in order to achieve the “boiling” action. Rather than continuously pull a deep vacuum to maintain the “boiling” action of the consumable substance throughout the process in order to cool and rapidly remove the water or consumable substance vapors from their “foodstuff” as done in the Smaltz's and Larson's processes described above, the process of the present invention is designed to regulate the amount and duration of negative pressure, within the optimal range of vacuum pressures at about −5 to −20 Hg in (inches of mercury) throughout the brewing/infusing process. However, in exemplary embodiments of the present invention, sufficient brewing/infusing pressures may also be regulated within a range of about −1 to −5 Hg in, or at pressures between −20 to −29.9 Hg in.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In embodiments of the present invention where a hot or heated consumable substance is used, the regulation of negative pressure is necessary to allow the hot or heated consumable substance to boil at the start of the brewing/infusing process in order to start the release of gasses from within the dried media or other infusion material. The “boiling” action in the hot consumable substance occurs once the vacuum enters the necessary range. This “boiling” action would slow or stop because of temperature loss if the vacuum is not increased, i.e., deepened, in relation to the temperature loss. The release of gasses is created as a result of the pores of the dried media or other infusion material opening up while under the regulated vacuum, allowing liquid to displace the gasses inside the pores of the dried media/infusion material and resulting in the gasses rising to the surface. This release of gasses continues the agitation and movement of the consumable substance and dried media/infusion material, throughout the remainder of the brewing/infusing cycle, which is important for the brewing/infusing process.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In one embodiment, the release of gasses as described herein may eliminate the need to use a deepening vacuum pressure to maintain the movement of the consumable substance throughout the brew/infuse cycle, therefore minimizing temperature and vapor loss, thus allowing the consumable substance and infusion material to stay within the desired temperature range. As pointed out above, a source of <figure-callout id=\"27\" label=\"energy\" filenames=\"US11421192-20220823-D00000.png,US11421192-20220823-D00001.png\" state=\"{{state}}\">energy</figure-callout> <b>27</b> may also be used, and may provide heat to offset or minimize temperature losses during the brewing/infusing process and to provide light to add a visual aid and or theatrical element to the process, or both.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In an embodiment of the present invention, a liquid distributed into the brewing/infusing chamber may be delivered through a spray, wherein the spray means may allow for the flow of liquid to be separated into a plurality of streams which may benefit specific brewing/infusing media. The streams may also include the addition of gasses to the delivered stream of liquid. The adding of gasses to the liquid mixture while the desired liquid volume comes in contact with the brewing/infusing media and liquid mass may provide increased turbulence. The addition of gasses may also allow for the expansion of the overall volume of the consumable substance and infusion material, and for further increases during the vacuum cycle. In a preferred embodiment, a gas may be introduced in an even manner and/or by saturating the brewing/infusing media prior to an atmosphere removal cycle.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The temperature of the liquid for the hot or heated consumable substance process may be achieved and maintained by numerous available methods. Methods for heating the consumable substance to the desired temperature may include, but are not limited to, available mechanisms such as hot or heated water or consumable substance holding tanks, as seen in conventional commercial brewing equipment or hot water or consumable substance on demand heat exchange systems, similar to those utilized commercially and in homes which replace traditional hot water heaters.

Alternatively, it has been found that good results are achieved if the vacuum is pulsed or cycled. That is, after the infusion material is mixed with the consumable substance, it is put under a vacuum for a desired time period, such as for about 5 seconds, and then brought back to atmospheric pressure for approximately 30 to 60 seconds. The vacuum is then reapplied for about another 5 seconds. The values listed above for the number or duration of vacuum pulses are by way of example only, as the process is not limited to these on/off times or to the number of pulses that may be applied during each brewing or infusing cycle. For example, in various embodiments of the present invention, the number of vacuum pulses or cycles can be 1 or more than 1, such as at least 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Similarly, the value for the duration of vacuum application can be more or less than 5 seconds, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, etc. Likewise, the value for the duration of time that the system is maintained at approximately atmospheric pressure, i.e., between applications of vacuum, can be less than 30 seconds, more than 60 seconds or somewhere between 30 and 60 seconds, such as 5, 10, 25, 75, etc. As should be readily apparent, the Central control unit can be used to control the brewing or infusing cycle and the number and duration of pulses as desired.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0081\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In one embodiment of the present invention, the magnitude of each vacuum cycle in a series of vacuum cycles may be different than the previous cycle. For example, each vacuum cycle in a series of vacuum cycles may be deeper than the previous cycle, i.e., the vacuum becomes progressively deeper with each successive cycle. Utilizing different vacuum depths at different points in the brew/infusion process can be beneficial to the brewing/infusing extraction. For instance, after each vacuum cycle, the consumable substance may cool, requiring the next vacuum cycle to be deeper than the previous cycle in order to maintain the same level of “boiling action” or extraction activity from cycle to cycle. By way of a non-limiting example, in the first cycle in a brew/infusion process the vacuum applied is about −5 Hg in. In the second cycle, the vacuum applied is about −7 Hg in. In the third cycle, the vacuum applied is about −9 Hg in, and so on, i.e., the vacuum is deepened with each successive cycle. Alternatively, the vacuum may be decreased, i.e., weakened, with each consecutive cycle, or may be increased or decreased with every other cycle. In various embodiments, the magnitude of vacuum applied for each consecutive cycle may change throughout the brew/infusion process, and can be higher, lower, or the same as the previous cycle. Accordingly, such changes in vacuum magnitude may be programmed to follow any pattern from cycle to cycle, as may be contemplated by one with reasonable skill in the art.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0082\" class=\"description-paragraph\">By way of non-limiting example only, brewing certain teas with the brewing cycle described above may take approximately 20-60 seconds. The cycling between negative and atmospheric pressure during such a period of time may allow for desirable soluble elements, such as sugars and polyphenols (antioxidants), to be extracted from the tea without using extraction aids, and may limit the extraction of undesirable elements, such as tannins, into the brewed result, for example. For example, Jade Cloud, a Japanese tea variety, is traditionally brewed at about 180° F. for about 180-240 seconds, but using the present invention allows for brewing at about 195° F. for about 65 seconds. An Iron Goddess of Mercy, for example, is traditionally brewed at about 195° F. for about 140-180 seconds, but using the present invention allows for brewing at 207° F. for about 65 seconds. Similarly, a Bai Hao Oolong, for example, is traditionally brewed at about 190° F. about for 35-120 seconds, but using the present invention allows for brewing at about 207° F. for about 65 seconds.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0083\" class=\"description-paragraph\">By way of further example, a Wuyi Oolong is traditionally brewed at about 200° F. for about 240 seconds, while using the present invention allows for brewing at about 207° F. for about 65 seconds. Further, a Golden Yunnan Organic, for example, is traditionally brewed at about 212° F. for about 240-300 seconds, while using the present invention allows for brewing at about 207° F. for about 65 seconds. Similarly, an Ancient Shu Pu-erh (vintage 2009), for example, is traditionally brewed at about 212° F. for about 180-240 seconds, while using the present invention allows for brewing at about 207° F. for about 88 seconds (which includes a pre-rinse of the tea). A Blueberry Rooibos, for example, is traditionally brewed at about 195° F. for about 300-420 seconds, while using the present invention allows for brewing at about 207° F. for about 65 seconds (which includes a pre-rinse of the tea). Of course, this and all embodiments herein may be used with cold brewing methods and known to those skilled in the art and as described herein.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0084\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The examples above indicate the typical difficulties of certain ingredients requiring long brewing/infusing times that are likely to arise in a commercial setting. In addition to more optimal extraction of soluble materials into the consumable substance, as discussed above, the present invention allows for commercially reasonable brewing/infusing cycle times, as well as providing increased product consistency (given the low variability in brew time), which is remedial for the aforementioned typical difficulties that arise from brewing/infusing in commercial settings—especially for high volume restaurants and coffee houses, for example. As will be discussed further herein, these advantages are also desirable in the home-use market.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0085\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In addition to commercial uses, the present invention may allow for a home or personal brewing/infusing device. Present day devices are either very convenient to use but provide a low quality of brewing, or offer a very good brewing process but at the cost of convenience to the consumer. The present invention provides both convenience (via at least the very short brew times) with unmatched quality and consistency (via at least the brewing/infusing process described above).</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0086\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The descriptions and examples of the methods of the present invention previously discussed herein are generally directed to brewing coffee and tea or infusing a liquid to create a beverage. In other embodiments, the device and methods described herein are useful for infusing a consumable substance with a spice, herb, botanical, vegetable, fruit, or other infusion material to create an infused consumable product other than a beverage. In such embodiments, the liquid or consumable substance to be infused can be an oil, for example a vegetable or cooking oil such as olive oil, canola oil, grape seed oil, sesame oil, a nut oil, or a citrus oil; an animal-derived oil, such as a fish oil; a fat, such as butter or lard; a wax; any type of vinegar; honey; or any other liquid suitable for use in a consumable product. The consumable substance can be a material that is a solid at room temperature, or even significantly above room temperature, but that is readily liquefied upon heating. Alternatively, the consumable substance can be a solid that does not readily liquefy upon heating, such as any type of meat or fat. Further, the consumable substance to be infused can be a mixture of solid and liquid materials, for example, any type of emulsion, sauce, marinade, or dressing. However, the consumable substance to be infused is not limited to the specific materials cited herein, and can comprise any edible material. Further, the infusion material can be any material useful for imparting a flavor to another material, as previously defined herein.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0087\" class=\"description-paragraph\">It is contemplated herein that the conditions of the infusion process of the present invention may be appreciably different than the conditions for the embodiments related to beverage brewing described elsewhere herein. For example, when the liquid or food product is an oil or a fat, higher temperatures and/or deeper vacuum may be used to obtain the same level of infusion, i.e., optimal extraction of the infusion material into the consumable substance, compared to a beverage brewing process using water as a liquid. Further, the conditions of the infusion process can be modified based on various characteristics of the consumable substance, for example, but not limited to, the viscosity, porosity, vapor pressure, or pH of the consumable substance.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In one embodiment of the present invention, the addition of the consumable substance and vacuum cycle may occur at substantially the same time. Although atmosphere removal may typically occur after the desired volume has been added to the brew mass, as the volume of desired consumable substance is added to the chamber, the vacuum may be allowed to build in the present invention. Such a technique may allow for reduced overall brewing/infusing process time, lower temperatures as the desired consumable substance enters the chamber, and removal of unwanted gasses from the infusion material, all while adding the desired amount of consumable substance.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Similarly, in an embodiment of the present invention, vacuum cycles may alternate, such as to allow for a partial filling of the chamber with the consumable substance, the application of a vacuum cycle, and a second or further addition of remaining consumable substance(s), additional consumable substance s, or the like. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the cycles can be repeated to allow for as many alternating cycles as desired, and may include, or not include, a vacuum draw per cycle. Likewise, vacuum cycles may be provided at alternate vacuums per cycle. For example, with regard to a series of three cycles having only a single vacuum cycle, the percentage of total consumable substance added before the vacuum cycle may be a function of the amount and type of the infusion material. The remaining amount of consumable substance which will be added after the vacuum process may be similarly dependent.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Cycling in this manner may force down the infusion material on the surface of the consumable substance present, adding to the amount of agitation of the infusion material. Further, and more particular to media such as coffee, for example, as the atmosphere is removed, an infusion material may release compounds and gases. For example, coffee may expel CO<sub>2 </sub>during atmosphere removal, which may result in the water and media mixture expanding higher in the brewing/infusing chamber, allowing for greater agitation and increased brewing or infusion.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Furthermore, the consumable substance added after the vacuum is released may provide for an increase in extraction of compounds from the media, i.e., infusion material. This can occur through the raising of the brewing/infusing mass temperature, the lowering of soluble concentrations (providing an increased potential from equilibrium), and thus may allow more solubles to be extracted, thereby forcing the infusion material which may be at the surface of the consumable substance down into the mass, and thereby increasing the agitation which occurs upon delivery of the additional consumable substance.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Furthermore, the addition of consumable substance to the system, and more specifically, after a vacuum cycle, may help rinse suspended infusion material, resulting from the expansion of the consumable substance and media during atmosphere removal, from the inner chamber walls after the at least partially applied vacuum is released and as the chamber equalizes with ambient pressure. After such cycling, it is preferable that at least a majority of material remaining in the chamber should be removed from the chamber walls to ensure that the subsequent batch is not contaminated by material from the previous batch. For example, the present invention may also provide a stream of water or liquid which may be sprayed onto the interior chamber walls to rinse down the material, i.e., a liquid rinse cycle. This liquid rinse cycle may be applied before, during, or after a brewing/infusing cycle, such that residual infusion material located on the chamber walls may be substantially removed from the walls and/or redirected to another part of the system.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In an embodiment of the present invention, the amount of time before a vacuum is applied may vary based upon the infusion material and may affect the amount of compounds released by the media. For example, a hold time of an additional 2-50 seconds, and more particularly such as 20 seconds, prior to the application of a vacuum cycle may allow for the release of flavor elements not otherwise released between the cycles.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0094\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Similarly, reducing the atmosphere of the chamber prior to the addition of the consumable substance, or at least a substantial portion of the consumable substance, may increase the rate at which the consumable substance is infused. For example, lowering the pressure prior to introducing the consumable substance may remove unwanted gas(es) from the infusion material, which may allow subsequent vacuum cycles, for example, to perform better extraction.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In an embodiment of the present invention, a water rinse cycle may precede any brewing or infusing cycles if, for example, the infusion material requires a rinse to wash unwanted components out of the infusion material prior to the brewing/infusing cycle(s). More specifically, certain media may require a pre-brew cycle rinse/brew be used in order to wash off undesirable taste elements. This process may consist of adding desired water volume, and additionally of one or more of the following steps: holding at atmospheric pressures for desired time; removing desired atmospheres for a desired time; separating the water from the infusion material so that the material is free from the liquid; and disposing of the pre-brew liquid. Then the unit may be prepared for a full brew/infusion cycle.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0096\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In an embodiment of the present invention, once the vacuum brewing/infusing process is complete, the infusion material may be separated by means of passing the liquid through a thin mesh or paper filter in order to separate the liquid from the remaining infusion material. The separation may require adequate pressure to push the liquid through the remaining undissolved material and the filter to a one-way valve opening, for example. During this separation, a means of pulsing of positive pressure may be utilized. For example, positive high and low pressure settings may create pressure variation, which may increase and release pressure on the material, thereby adding additional extraction to the brewing/infusing process after vacuum brewing/infusion has occurred. Positive pressure may be applied in various ways, as would be understood by a person with reasonable skill in the art. For example, positive pressure could be created by supplying a gas, such as air, carbon dioxide or nitrogen, to the chamber or vessel of the present invention. In one exemplary embodiment, the positive pressure applied should sufficiently separate the liquid from the remaining solid infusion material. For example, the applied pressure may be between 1-10 psig, or in another example, the applied pressure may be greater than 10 psig.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0097\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In other embodiments, the methods and apparatus described herein may be used with a pre-packaged pod-type delivery system, such as a KEURIG brewing system or the like, or with pre-packaged beverage pods, such as K-CUP packs or the like. Generally, in such brewing systems, a single serving of beverage is brewed by passing hot water through a container that has been pre-packaged with brew material and a filter. In one embodiment of the present invention, a person with reasonable skill in the art could modify the apparatus of the present invention to use pre-packaged beverage or infusion material pods, instead of using loose brewing or infusion material in the brewing/infusing chamber, in order to perform the methods of the present invention. In another embodiment, a person with reasonable skill in the art could modify a pre-packaged pod-type delivery apparatus to perform the methods of the present invention, for instance, by modifying the apparatus to apply negative or positive pressure to the pre-packaged beverage or infusion material pods used in the apparatus and/or by modifying the pre-packaged beverage or infusion material pods to accommodate changes in pressure or temperature.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0098\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In an embodiment of the present invention, in order to create an optimal product free of insoluble materials with specific infusion material with fine particles, a new one of the paper like filters may be used for each cycle. Upon completion of the brewing/infusing process, the paper and the remaining undissolved elements may be removed and discarded. This process may be performed manually or may be automated.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0099\" class=\"description-paragraph\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic system diagram illustrating an infusion system in accordance with the present invention.

By way of non-limiting example, fruit (fresh or dried) may be placed in a <figure-callout id=\"220\" label=\"canister\" filenames=\"US11421192-20220823-D00003.png\" state=\"{{state}}\">canister</figure-callout> <b>220</b> wherein water may be added. A vacuum may then be applied to the solution containing the water and fruit material—a cycling process which may be repeated to enhance the extraction and such as is discussed herein. The infused product may be dispensed through the following ways, by way of non-limiting example: directly after the required vacuum cycles are complete, CO<sub>2 </sub>is added to the infused liquid; after the required vacuum cycles are complete, additional water is added to the infused solution; and/or the initial infusion water has a higher temperature to thus increase the infusion process, while the secondary water may be delivered at an ice-cold temperature to chill the beverage and reduce the temperature for delivery. Further, for example, at any point in the processes discussed herein, such as after the additional water is added to an infused liquid, the product may be carbonated.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0102\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Further, in an embodiment of the present invention and as referenced above, spirits, or other consumable material, may be introduced into the brewed/infused mixture during processing and/or for infusion. For example, the present invention may allow for the infusion of spirits (for example, vodka) with natural extracts from fresh or dried fruit. By way of non-limiting example only, fruit (fresh or dried) may be placed in a sealable environment (canister <b>240</b>) along with an alcoholic liquid. The environment may be sealed and a vacuum applied to the solution containing the alcoholic liquid and fruit material—and the vacuum may be repeated/cycled to enhance the extraction. The post-brewing/infusing process may be combined with the immediate application of a chilling device or methods to immediately reduce the temperature of the solution, such as the application of ice or an instant chiller sleeve and/or another chilling environment.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0103\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Similarly, spirits may be added in a brewing/infusing process in order to infuse a consumable substance. For example, a spirit may be infused, such as during or following a vacuum cycled brewing/infusing process, into, for example, a tea or coffee brew. In various embodiments of the present invention, spirits may be infused into a beverage such that the final product is at least 2% alcohol, i.e., ethanol, by volume. For example, in one embodiment, beer comprising about 2-12% alcohol by volume (ABV) may be infused. In another embodiment, wines, typically comprising 9-16% ABV, may be infused. In another embodiment, liqueurs, typically comprising 15-55% ABV, may be infused. In yet another embodiment, other spirits, such as rum, brandy, or grain alcohol, with alcohol content of 60% ABV or higher, may be infused.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0104\" class=\"description-paragraph\">After the coffee, tea or other consumable substance has brewed or been infused for the desired amount of time, the heat and vacuum are turned off and the chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure. The <figure-callout id=\"24\" label=\"table top\" filenames=\"US11421192-20220823-D00000.png,US11421192-20220823-D00001.png\" state=\"{{state}}\">table top</figure-callout> <b>24</b> is then lowered to release the <figure-callout id=\"18\" label=\"vessel\" filenames=\"US11421192-20220823-D00000.png,US11421192-20220823-D00001.png\" state=\"{{state}}\">vessel</figure-callout> <b>18</b>. The contents of the chamber can then be strained by any traditional means such as by using French press screens or paper filters.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0105\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The separation of liquid and media may also occur as an automated step in the process. This process would occur once the brewing/infusion is complete and the vacuum is released. The pump <b>1</b> could then activate and, through proper valving, pressurize the chamber, forcing the liquid through a screen below the coffee grounds or other media and out a one way valve in the bottom of the chamber. Such a step would, of course, require a modified chamber that includes a one way valve in the center of the base and a screen to cover the inside bottom of the vessel in order to separate the solid media from the liquid during the dispensing process.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0106\" class=\"description-paragraph\">There are numerous alternative embodiments for the cycling discussed above, such as the amount of consumable substance used, and the amount of vacuum applied (which may vary by amount and/or type of material to be brewed/infused). For example, coffee may be brewed using just a single vacuum cycle, but may be brewed with more than one water-additive cycle. For example, regardless of the number of cycles, the volume of water used may be less than the amount used in the finished product. Enough water may be employed to effectively brew the selected material with water added to the final beverage after the brewing process is completed. For example, four (4) ounces of water may be used in the vacuum brewing process for coffee, while an additional eight (8) ounces of water may be added to the brewed product to create a final twelve (12) ounces of coffee. Thereby, an espresso may be optionally provided, or a coffee, or a cappuccino (such as wherein espresso may be initially brewed, followed by a brew with milk). In short, the amount of water used during the at least one vacuum cycle may vary and is dependent upon the amount of material being brewed and/or the desired strength of the final product (although the addition of water may be used to control the concentration of the final product).</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0107\" class=\"description-paragraph\">As discussed above, the brewing/infusing cycle of the present invention may allow for brewing times approximately one-fifth of standard brewing times. Such a reduction in time may allow for the brewing/infusing of commercial offerings that would otherwise have an undesirable brewing time or that typically cannot be satisfactorily brewed in a practical manner. For example, the increase in sugar extraction and reduction in tannin extraction by the present invention over traditional brewing/infusing methods, as described above, may allow a consumer of the brewed beverage or product to limit or exclude any addition sweetener(s) that would otherwise be necessary to mask the taste of tannins and/or supplement the amount of sugars in the beverage. Thus, beverages or products brewed or infused using the present invention may, if packaged as an end product, such as a bottled iced tea, contain less added sweetener(s) and/or less calories, and/or may maintain taste and quality without need of sweeteners or other additives.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0109\" num=\"0108\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In addition, using bottled iced tea as an example, the present invention may allow for the production of bottled teas which contain about nine (9) times more polyphenols than standard commercially sold bottled teas. In short, the present invention may allow for a bottled tea which has reduced tannins, higher levels of natural sugars and antioxidants, while offering a greater array of tea choices. For example, a local café may brew and bottle iced teas for sale in their establishment and/or for sale to other local vendors.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0110\" num=\"0109\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Although these may be produced at anytime, given the short brewing/infusing times discussed above, employees of a commercial café who may be experiencing a slow down in foot traffic may engage in the brewing and bottling of beverages on-site (teas in this example). Such impromptu activity may allow the employee to become more effectively utilized and may allow for a targeted and efficient offering of packaged beverages. For example, the local café may be able to control production very closely given the near instantaneous evaluation of consumer demand based on prior sales, local weather, actual inventory and real-time consumption data, for example. Production control may include the shear volume of product produced and/or the type of product produced.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0111\" num=\"0110\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Further, such brewing process may be combined with various methods of commercial bottling and beverage stabilization that protects flavor and nutritional shelf life. For example, tea, herbs, and/or fruit (fresh or dried) may be placed in a sealable environment (canister, etc). Water may be added to the sealable environment that contains the fruit material. The brewing environment may be sealed and a vacuum may be applied to the solution containing the water and fruit material—this may be repeated to enhance the extraction.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0112\" num=\"0111\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Before the infused solution is dispensed, additional water, or other liquid, may be added to the infused solution. The initial infusion liquid or consumable substance may have a higher temperature to increase the infusion process, while the secondary addition of liquid or consumable substance may be delivered at a colder temperature to chill the beverage or product and reduce the temperature. For instance, the secondary addition of liquid may be delivered at a temperature in the range of 32°-50° F. Additives may also be used that protect flavor and nutritional shelf life of the beverage or product.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0113\" num=\"0112\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Given the brew/infusion times possible with the present invention, choices with regard to the type of beverages or products produced may be made with great efficiency and responsiveness to consumer demand, not only holding inventory at optimal levels, but also minimizing waste of unsold and expired product (expired product may be product older than 45 days, for example), especially when using very expensive starting materials, such as rare teas, for example. Where traditional methods have failed, the real-time “batch” production of the present invention enables production of cold-storage beverages at the point of sale and eliminates external ordering processes, delivery of goods, and maintenance of a remote production facility, for example.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0114\" num=\"0113\" class=\"description-paragraph\">Although many examples of tea and coffee brewing have been provided herein, the present invention may be used to brew any beverage where water, spirits, or any other consumable substance generally is used to extract certain bodies from a particular medium. For example, hops, barley and malt, alone or in combination, may be brewed and/or steeped for use alone or as a part of a beverage combination. The present invention may shorten the steep time often associated with processing hops, barley and/or malts for use in beverages, and may allow for improved extraction and flavor qualities over traditional processes. For example, traditional steeping times may range from 20 to 40 minutes at about 150° F. to about 170° F., for example, wherein the present invention may provide steeping in about 6 to 10 minutes at about 180° F. to about 220° F.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0115\" num=\"0114\" class=\"description-paragraph\">In an embodiment of the present invention, the regulation of vacuum cycles may be in direct relationship to the optimal extraction of coffee solubles of 18-22% of the total 30% of the solids available for targeting to be dissolved from given coffee matter (as defined by the Specialty Coffee Association of America and the Specialty Coffee Association of Europe). The extraction is measured through charting of the total dissolved solids, provided by testing the brewed beverage with a digital refractometer, and charting of the data in the use of the Brewing Control Chart, as used by the SCAA and SCAE. By way of example, the total dissolved solids of a brewed beverage may be analyzed using the methods and apparatus described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,952,697 issued to Fedele et al. (Coffee Refractometer Method and Apparatus).</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0115\" class=\"description-paragraph\">For example, in an embodiment of the present invention, the optimal vacuum depth to utilize for hot brewing to obtain 18-22% extraction may be from 3-14 psig. Vacuum ranges and cycles with lower times and depth may result in <figure-callout id=\"18\" label=\"sub\" filenames=\"US11421192-20220823-D00000.png,US11421192-20220823-D00001.png\" state=\"{{state}}\">sub</figure-callout> 18% extraction ranges therefore resulting in a less than favorable extraction rate. However, vacuum ranges and cycles with higher times and depth may result in greater than 22% extraction which will result in a greater than favorable extraction rate.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0117\" num=\"0116\" class=\"description-paragraph\">The disclosures of each and every patent, patent application, and publication cited herein are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</div>\n    <div id=\"p-0118\" num=\"0117\" class=\"description-paragraph\">While this invention has been disclosed with reference to specific embodiments, it is apparent that other embodiments and variations of this invention may be devised by others skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.
